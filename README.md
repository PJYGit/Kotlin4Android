# Kotlin4Android
Self-learning reposiitory of kotlin for Android Programming including some simple projects.

The source codes of different parts can be seen at directory /FirstLineOfCode/*. I deleted some procedural codes cause it's too simple which means some codes shown in the note-files can't be seen in the projects. The codes remained in the above directory are the ones which are worthwhile to show.

All the notes can be seen at directory /Notes/*.md.
